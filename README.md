Ganbatte is a educational program, primarily based around language learning, but can be used for a wide variety of knowledge! It uses a Lua scripting system for bringing lessons to life. The lua scripting system gives lesson makers all the freedom they need to make lessons - they don't need to be restricted to things like spaced repetition!
